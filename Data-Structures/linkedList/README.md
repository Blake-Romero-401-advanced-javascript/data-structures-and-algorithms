# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Instantiate a singly linked list adding methods for functionality and test the functionality.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create singly linked list and methods insert taht inserts a new node into the list, includes which searches the list of nodes for an item, and toString that lists out the full list of values.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the class approach and utilized while loops to iterate through while node heads exist and are not null. The Big O space/time is o(n) depending on the size of the list which will grow in time and space by n.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
insert(value)
- inserts a value into a new node
includes(value)
- checks the list for a value
toString()
- runs the list and returns it.
